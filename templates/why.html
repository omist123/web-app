    <h1> Why do I want to be in Honors American Studies?</h1>
    <p>The main reason I want to be in this class is because this year in world studies I wasn't challenged too much with the work we had. So I am hoping that if I take Honors I will have more of a challenge and the class will better suited for me compared to CP.</p>
